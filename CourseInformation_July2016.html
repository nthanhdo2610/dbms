<p class="p9">The textbook is REALLY excellent with a very large amount of practical knowledge that can be used in the marketplace. &nbsp;You will always want to keep this book for your career.<br />
We will use this textbook for every lesson (and homework), and the exam questions will be based on the knowledge in this textbook.<br />

You are spending many thousands of dollars on our courses, so it is wise to spend a few more dollars on a book which will help you gain the necessary knowledge, and thereby get a better grade in the course.<br />
<br />
<span class="s8"><strong>Reference Books:</strong></span><br />
The course text book, lesson notes, slides and web references should be sufficient. Other materials are listed against the possibility of easy access through a friend or local library. Also you can google your queries.&nbsp; A google query such as &quot;tutorial on X&quot; will produce many hits.</p>

<p class="p8"><strong>Sakai Forum:</strong></p>

<p class="p9">It is mandatory to use this forum where we&#39;ll be discussing course related topics. &nbsp;I want to encourage all the students to share what they find useful and informative for the course. Along with the forum, we&#39;ll be using sakai messaging feature using which you can send me personal emails related to the course.&nbsp;<br />
<span class="s1">Note: Forum participation has 5% weightage towards your complete course grade.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="s6"><strong>Grading:</strong></span><span class="s9">&nbsp;</span><br />

<span class="s6"><strong>Mandatory Student Participation:</strong></span><span class="s9">&nbsp;</span><br />
Because we&nbsp;sometimes had students who were registered in a course, but did not participate and then much later withdrew, after requiring ongoing administrative and faculty attention, we now have a new requirement that you submit the assignments given in the first 2 weeks of the course, to indicate that you are indeed active in the course and intend to continue in it. It will also be necessary for you to show ongoing participation and progress in the course to be able to take the midterm &amp; final exams.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For this course, you need to satisfy the following 3 requirements to keep yourself enrolled in the course.<br />
<span class="s10">1) Send a reply to the &quot;welcome&quot; thread in Sakai forum introducing yourself. &nbsp;You should do this within 2 weeks of the course start date.<br />
2) Submit the 1st assignment of the course NOT LATER than 2 weeks after the course has started.<br />
3) Submit the 2</span><span class="s11">nd</span><span class="s10">&nbsp;assignment of the course NOT LATER than 3 weeks after the course has started.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="s12"><strong>Failure to comply with the above requirements will result in a student&rsquo;s dismissal from the course with a grade of NC and the cost of the course incurred.</strong></span><br />
<span class="s3">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p8"><strong>Academic Honesty PLEASE READ CAREFULLY !!!:</strong></p>

<p class="p9">Please take a moment to read the MUM Academic Conduct Policy&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cs.miu.edu/admin/Academic%20Honesty%20policy.html"><span class="s4">here.</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;And note that academic dishonesty will not be tolerated at any cost.<br />
The purpose of our homework and lab assignments is to give each student practical experience in applying the knowledge gained from lectures and readings. This hands-on experience is needed to learn the details of how to apply the knowledge. Therefore, it is against academic policy to copy, or share with others, any homework or lab projects that are assigned as individual work.<br />
You may discuss the course material, concepts, or ideas with other students. You may review together the relevant topics from lectures or readings to help understand the principles required to start a programming assignment. You can prepare for the exam together, discussing and working on various problems and expected questions. In essence, you can collaborate freely in any course-related work that is not required for submission and evaluated by the instructor.<br />
Under no circumstances should you post your lab or homework solutions on a course newsgroup, send via email, or in any other way distribute to others. Every student is expected to work individually on his or her own lab project, exams, and anything else being evaluated as part of the course grade.<br />
If you are found to have violated this policy for a quiz, assignment or lab, then you will receive no credit for that homework. If the violation occurs for an exam, you will receive no credit for the course, and be subject to disciplinary measures by the Dean of Students, with possible dismissal from the graduate program.<br />
<span class="s3">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p8"><strong>DE Online Course Evaluations:</strong></p>

<p class="p9">You are required to complete a student course evaluation for this course after the midterm exam and again after the final exam. The DE office will send email reminders when these are due. To complete the DE Student Learning Inventory Form, access&nbsp;<a href="http://infosys.cs.mum.edu/"><span class="s4">http://infosys.cs.miu.edu/</span></a>.&nbsp; If you have questions concerning this requirement, direct them to the&nbsp;DE director.&nbsp;<br />
