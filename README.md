# DBMS

### Course Summary

Database systems organize and retrieve information, allowing the user to access the desired information easily and efficiently.  This course includes the following topics: Relational data model, Relational algebra, SQL, ER modeling, Data normalization, Transactions, Database design, Database recovery, Query processing, Distributed databases, and a study of a specific commercial database system (MS-SQL Server).

### Objectives
The course is divided into two halves, Lessons 1 – 7 and Lessons 8 – 14. The principle objectives for the first half are skill in creating entity-relationship diagrams, normalized relational models and structured query language (SQL). The principle objectives for the second half of the course are skill with transaction control, logical and physical database design, distributed databases and database recovery.

The list below identifies some of the skills we aim to develop during the course:

#### - Relational Model
- Create relational models and identify all types of keys
- Estimate space required for relational model
- Analyze transactions to decide on primary and secondary indexes
- Analyze space and time impact of indexing options

#### - SQL
- Translate a question in English into a query in SQL
- Represent queries in relational algebra
- Perform query optimization using relational algebra
- Estimate the cost of processing a query

#### - Entity-Relation Model
- Represent a business model by an entity-relationship diagram
- Refine entity-relationship models
- Map entity-relationship models to relational models

#### - Normalization
- Detect insertion, update, and deletion anomalies
- Identify non-trivial functional dependencies
- Normalize a relational model according to the six normal forms

#### - Transaction Management
- Test for deadlock and non-recoverability
- Apply deadlock prevention and recovery policies to schedules

<p>We do not expect to master all these skills, but we should get a taste of them all.
The list of principle objectives above, the lesson notes, and the selection of homework exercises indicate what to emphasize.
